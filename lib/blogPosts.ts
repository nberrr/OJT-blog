    description: "My first week of OJT was filled with new faces, unfamiliar systems, and unexpected challenges.",
    content: `
      <p>My first week at the company was a whirlwind of new experiences. I arrived early on Monday, nervous but excited about what lay ahead. The office was larger than I expected, with an open floor plan that seemed designed to encourage collaboration.</p>
      <h2>Delayed Start but Productive Beginning</h2>
      <p> Our deployment was delayed due to paperwork issues, making us three weeks late from the original schedule. However, as we officially began Week 1, we made sure to maximize our time and productivity.</p>
      <p> This week, we focused on setting up our workspace—installing PCs, crimping and setting up LAN cables, and organizing our workstations. We actively participated in meetings and were assigned our tasks. The major task, called the "Rock Task," revolves around a system we'll be working on, while our minor tasks involve other responsibilities. I was assigned to collateral report layout, which aligns with my other skills.</p>
      <p>Determined to make the most of our first week, I worked on wireframing, layout design, and even tried creating a mock-up logo for the system. Despite the late start, we ensured a productive week, setting a strong foundation for the coming days.</p>

    content: `
     <p>Week two was all about finding my rhythm and establishing routines. The initial overwhelm began to subside as I became more familiar with the office environment and daily procedures.</p>

<p>Our OJT coordinator also visited us during the week to check in and speak with our on-site supervisors about our progress and overall performance.</p>

<h2>Diving into Tasks</h2>
<p>This week marked the real start of our hands-on work in the Management Information System (MIS) Department. With guidance from the employees, we got deeper into our assigned tasks and adapted to the workflow.</p>
<p>One of my key focuses was wireframing, ensuring that the structure of our project was well-planned and visually organized. We attended meetings to align our progress, submitted our weekly report, and underwent a realignment of tasks to ensure everyone was on track.</p>
<p>To start by Week 3, I was also assigned the task of revising brochures, improving their layout and content to make them more engaging and professional. This involved careful attention to design and formatting while making sure the message remained clear and effective.</p>
<p>Our weekly meetings were a crucial part of our routine. We discussed our progress, addressed any issues, and planned our next steps. The meetings were structured to ensure everyone was on the same page and to facilitate collaboration.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, we continued learning from our mentors, gaining insights into best practices and problem-solving approaches in MIS. It was a productive and insightful week, setting a strong foundation for the tasks ahead!</p>

    content: `
      <p>Week three marked a significant shift in my OJT experience as I faced my first real challenge. The comfortable routine I had begun to establish was disrupted, pushing me out of my comfort zone and testing my abilities.</p>
      <h2>The Rock Task</h2>
<p>This week marked the beginning of actual development as we started coding the front end of the RSTL Appointment Portal. With most of the wireframes finalized, we focused on building the layout, ensuring the interface aligns with the planned user experience.</p>
  <p>Final touches were made to the wireframes to lock in structure and flow, giving us a clear path forward. It felt good to shift from planning to seeing our design take shape on screen.</p>
  <p>Midweek, we joined an earthquake drill, a brief but important reminder to stay prepared and flexible, qualities that also help during unexpected bugs or issues in development.</p>
  <p>One of the highlights was meeting with the RSTL end users and admin. We shared our progress and gathered their input, which helped us better understand their needs and expectations. Their feedback was insightful and will guide improvements moving forward.</p>
  <p>Week 3 was productive and motivating, a solid step from concept to code, backed by collaboration and real-world feedback.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Week four centered around collaboration and teamwork. After the intensity of last week's individual challenge, this week provided valuable lessons in working effectively with others and the power of collective effort.</p>
      <h2>Still Building, With One Less Hand</h2>
      <p>This week, we continued coding the front end of the RSTL Appointment Portal. Progress is steady as we work on bringing the system's interface and functionality to life. Each step forward is a reminder of how far we've come since planning.</p>
      <p>We also had a hands-on lecture on server upgrading. It was a valuable learning experience that gave us a clearer understanding of the backend side of the system and how to prepare it for deployment. This session added depth to our technical knowledge and made us more aware of the full system architecture.</p>
      <p>Amidst the progress, we also experienced a bit of loss. One of our project technical assistants, Kuya Vince, resigned. He had been one of our Kuyas throughout this journey, quietly helping and guiding us. His departure was unexpected and left us feeling a little incomplete as a team. Still, we're thankful for the time he was with us and for everything he contributed.</p>
      <p>As Week 4 ends, we carry on with development — growing as a team, learning as we go, and adjusting to changes along the way.</p>

      <p>A meaningful week filled with development work, celebration, and self-care during the peak of Women’s Month.</p>
      <h2>Celebrating Women's Month with Care and Progress</h2>
      <p>Week 5 was both productive and refreshing as we continued our development tasks while also celebrating the peak of Women's Month. The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) prepared a special treat for everyone — a buffet and a free pamper day with services from head to toe, including massages, haircuts, and more.</p>
      <p>We were invited to enjoy the services too. I personally got a haircut and a relaxing hand massage, while some of my co-interns made the most of the experience by availing every service offered. It was a thoughtful gesture that truly lifted everyone's spirits.</p>
      <p>The DOST lobby was also livelier than usual, with booths selling various products — from snacks to small items, creating a mini marketplace vibe that added to the festive atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Despite the celebration, development didn't stop. We continued working on the systems assigned with the same drive and focus. It was a great reminder that taking care of people goes hand in hand with moving forward in our work.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Week 6 came with a full set of tasks that pushed us to manage our time and responsibilities carefully. One of our assignments was to create a draft layout for our internship ID. It was a fun and creative break from our usual system work. After finalizing our designs, we also laminated the IDs ourselves, which made the experience feel more hands-on and personal.</p>
      <h2>Designing, Presenting, and Progressing</h2>
      <p>A key part of this week was our progress report presentation. Each team presented updates on their systems to our head and senior programmer. It was a chance to showcase what we've accomplished so far and get valuable feedback. I was given the opportunity to present my contribution to the RSTL Appointment Portal, specifically the UI/UX design of the admin dashboard. I explained the flow, layout decisions, and how the design supports user needs. It was a proud moment to articulate the work I've done and see how it fits into the bigger system.</p>
      <p>Aside from development and presentations, we also received new supplies this week. These were added to our tools and resources for working more efficiently. We took the time to update our inventory list to make sure everything was documented properly — a reminder that even small details matter when working as a team.</p>
      <p>This week helped us balance creativity, technical progress, and team responsibility. As we move forward, we carry with us the feedback we received and a stronger sense of ownership over our roles in the project.</p>

      <p>Week 7 was all about refining our outputs and stepping in to assist with various tasks around the office. On the development side, we focused on the admin dashboard for the RSTL Appointment Portal. This included realigning the dashboard contents to ensure better visual flow and usability — small changes that made a big difference in the overall user experience.</p>
      <h2>Refining, Assisting, and Taking Part</h2>
      <p>In addition to coding, we were also tapped to help with event preparation for the upcoming Kapehan. We packed merchandise that would be used during the event, working together to make sure everything was organized and ready.</p>
      <p>We also assisted during the flag-lowering ceremony, helping with the setup and ensuring that everything ran smoothly. It was a good opportunity to be involved in workplace traditions and show support for the agency's activities.</p>
      <p>Lastly, we were able to apply our technical skills beyond the system by helping troubleshoot printer issues — a reminder that even the simplest tasks can contribute to keeping the workplace running efficiently.</p>
      <p> Overall, Week 7 was a balanced mix of development work, collaboration, and on-the-ground support. Each task, whether big or small, added to our learning and sense of responsibility.</p>

      <p>Before the Holy Week break, we had only two and a half working days — but we made the most of them. We performed system maintenance in groups, reinstalled OS, applied thermal paste for the first time, and assisted the RSTL department with Microsoft Office issues.</p>
      <h2>Short Days, Lasting Skills</h2>
      <p>Week 8 was short due to the Holy Week break, but it gave us plenty of chances to get our hands dirty — literally and technically. We were grouped into teams of three to carry out preventive maintenance on system units. This included cleaning the hardware, checking for issues, and reinstalling operating systems to refresh performance.</p>
      <p>For me, a personal milestone was applying thermal paste for the first time — and on my own laptop. It was a new and exciting learning experience that gave me insight into the importance of hardware care.</p>
      <p>Aside from maintenance, we also helped out the RSTL department by assisting in the reactivation of a corrupted Microsoft Office suite, practicing our problem-solving skills with real cases.</p>
      <p>Despite the shortened workweek, it was fulfilling and educational — proof that even limited time can lead to meaningful progress.</p>

      <p>In Week 9, we focused on organizing and preparing for the upcoming Innovation Summit South Luzon scheduled for April 28-29. I was assigned as technical standby support, helping with troubleshooting, printing, laminating, and organizing supplies to ensure everything runs smoothly.Week 9 was all about preparation and teamwork. We held meetings to align our designated roles for the Innovation Summit, and I was tasked with providing technical standby support and assistance throughout the event.</p>
      <h2>Preparing for the Innovation Summit: Roles and Readiness</h2>
      <p>Preparation, teamwork, and attention to detail took center stage this past week. We were advised to pause all ongoing development processes to fully focus on the upcoming Innovation Summit South Luzon at Pepperland Hotel, Legazpi, scheduled for April 28-29.</p>
      <p>Several meetings were held to clearly define and align our roles. One key meeting with the event organizers ensured the program would flow smoothly and addressed any last-minute concerns.</p>
      <p>I was assigned to the technical standby support and assistance team. My tasks included troubleshooting printers that often act up during busy events, laminating IDs for staff and guests, printing brochures and giveaways, and assisting in preparing presentations for speakers. Though some tasks were repetitive, they were essential for the event’s success.</p>
      <p>We also gathered and organized supplies — from stationery to signage — making sure no detail was overlooked. I helped check that all equipment was working properly and ensured backup resources were ready in case of technical issues.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the preparations, we also had a photography lesson and hands-on session. It was a refreshing experience that introduced us to the basics of capturing professional shots and using a DSLR properly. The session gave us insights into how media coverage and documentation contribute to successful event execution.</p>
      <p>This week emphasized collaboration and communication. Coordinating with different teams, from admin to event planners, showed how each role supports the larger goal. It was rewarding to see how our combined efforts would contribute to a successful summit.</p>
      <p>Through these experiences, I deepened my problem-solving skills and learned the importance of being prepared for unexpected challenges. This week reinforced that solid preparation behind the scenes is what truly makes big events successful.</p>

      <p>This week centered around the highly anticipated Innovation Summit South Luzon held at Pepperland Hotel, Legazpi. We participated in the full event cycle — from ingress and setup to technical standby and post-event reflections — witnessing firsthand how major events are executed with precision, teamwork, and adaptability.</p>
      <h2>From Set-Up to Success: Behind the Innovation Summit</h2>
      <p>The excitement for the Innovation Summit South Luzon started early — literally. We reported for overtime on Sunday to help with ingress and prepare the venue at Pepperland Hotel, assisting in transporting equipment and materials from DOST and familiarizing ourselves with the entire layout.</p>
      <p>I was assigned as a technical standby support. Before the summit officially began, we toured the event areas to understand where simultaneous activities would take place. This helped us be prepared for any issues that could arise during the event proper.</p>
      <p>Day 1 was an intense but rewarding start. We arrived very early to help set up before the arrival of high-profile guests from across South Luzon, including DOST regional directors, agency heads, and walk-in participants. The day included simultaneous events — the Opening Ceremony, media interviews, and breakout activities happening on other floors. We remained alert and ready, resolving technical issues as they came.</p>
      <p>Day 2 continued the momentum with the same level of energy and professionalism. The consistency in support, coordination, and presence helped make the summit a complete success.</p>
      <p>Our experience was made more meaningful thanks to the guidance and support from the MIS and S&T Promotions team, especially Ma’am Sheen, who always looked out for us despite the hectic schedule. Her leadership made us feel seen and appreciated.</p>
      <p>Back at the office, we gathered for a post-event debrief where DOST expressed their gratitude for our contributions. Hearing that our efforts made a real difference in the event’s success was incredibly fulfilling.</p>
      <p>This week was an unforgettable highlight of our OJT — a chance to apply our technical skills in a high-stakes environment and grow through real-world teamwork. </p>
